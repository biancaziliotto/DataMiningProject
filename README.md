# Data Mining of US Shootings Dataset

Project for the exam of Data Mining.

The project focuses on the extraction of information and patterns from datasets regarding shootings, political parties, and poverty percentages in the US. The analysis takes into consideration events between 2013 and 2018.

We explore various techniques regarding data processing and understanding, clustering, classification and time series analysis.

The analysis experimental results are presented in the file <i>DM_Report</i>.

## Quickstart

To download the data (including the datasets resulting from the running of the file <i>1_DU&P.ipynb</i>)
> sh det_dataset.sh

The code is all implemented in jupyter notebooks, which should be ran sequentially (order is identified in the notebook's name).
If you'd like you can avoid running the first notebook to save some time because the resulting <i>final_dataset.csv</i> is downloadable with the previous command.
